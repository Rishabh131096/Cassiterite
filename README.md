Gesture Recognition

This project recognizes simple gestures. Just plain Mathematics and intuition.
Developed in Python and OpenCV.

Gestures are recognized after calibration is done. Calibration involves placing the hand in the designated area and stretching all fingers.
After that, gestures are detected live with the use of webcam.
